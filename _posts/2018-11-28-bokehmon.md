# Intro to bokehmon  

bokehmon is what I'm calling a project I've been thinking about for several months now.  I'm not really a photography person, but Bokeh is the blurring effect you get when parts of an image are out of focus.  This effect tends to make photos look better, more professional, by adding depth of field or depth of focus.  It highlights a particular object, with the blurred background and foreground making it visually "pop."  Here's an example:

I was inspired by one of those filters people put on shared photos that blurs the outer edges of the frame.  This simple trick may make the photo look better, but I wondered if we could do better.  For many images you would want to carefully select the parts of the image to be blurred.  There are apps designed to help you do this kind of editing, such as Bokeh Lens.  In these apps you usually choose the areas you want to blur and how blurry you want them.

But an interesting pattern-recognition problem is to identify the parts of the photo to blur so that the end result looks good.  And I thought, "maybe a machine could learn how to do this."  So that's what bokehmon is all about.  Along the way, my goal is to learn more about deep learning and tools like TensorFlow.

# Getting started

I quickly realized that this is a big problem.  So the first step is to determine whether I can train a machine to recognize and identify bokeh in images.  Deep learning has pretty much solved the problem of image recognition in the last few years, so this seems like the easy part.

First I wanted to re-train an existing state-of-the-art model, using transfer learning to better classify images. It's not clear to me how well usual object recognition models will translate to detecting bokeh, but I'll find out.  Tensorflow has a nice tutorial [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining).  But first, I had to update my OS, re-install Python 3 via Anaconda, then install tensorflow and tensorflow hub.  I also quickly worked through the general TensorFlow [tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).  Then I was ready to start training on image data.
